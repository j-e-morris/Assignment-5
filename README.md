*FISH 497 - Intro to Environmental Data Science*

### TASK: Practice creating an expository figure

For this assignment, I explore the Lake Superior trout dataset from the [{FSAdata}](https://github.com/droglenc/FSAdata) package to practice creating an expository figure from exploratory analyses.

I compare the relationship between trout length `len` and weight `wgt` and highlight the relationship for the Deer Park location.
